This package is for retrieving biological sequence data from the
National Center for Biotechnology Infomration (NCBI) via their entrez
web service.

* HTTP retrieval

HTTP retrieval is done using Edi Weitz's fine DRAKMA package

* XML

closure-xml

* DTDs

The NCBI entrez XML data formats make use of XML DTDs which means
that these DTDs need to be available to the system at the time the XML
files are loaded. This can either be done over the web by fetching the
DTDs via http or they can be found locally by looking up the
corresponding based on its public identifier. Local copies of NCBIs
DTDs are stored in the DTD directory.
