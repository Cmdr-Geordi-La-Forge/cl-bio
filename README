Cyrus Harmon, October 2006

Welcome to the cl-bio project. The idea is that this project will
serve as a trivial lisp-based analog of the BioPerl project. Simple,
light-weight versions of biological objects and methods on these
obejcts will be provided.

Initial biological objects:

Sequences: simple implementations of packed 2-bit DNA and RNA
sequences (A,C,G,T and A,C,G,U, respectively)

Ranges: directed ranges with a start and an end, as well as double
stranded ranges (ds-range) with an additional strand field, with
options +plus-strand+, +minus-strand+, +unknown-strand+, and
+both-strands+.
